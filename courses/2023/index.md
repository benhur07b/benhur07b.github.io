Each course focuses on a particular topic or theme and provides a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter. The 2023 version includes a total of 11 courses covering a diverse range of topics from introductory lessons to advanced visualization and processing:

- QGIS: Essentials
- QGIS: Expressions
- QGIS: Working with Layers
- QGIS: Advanced Styling and Symbology
- QGIS: Working with Maps and Layouts

- Spatial SQL and PostGIS: Essentials

If you are looking to gain fundamental skills, I highly recommend starting with the QGIS: Essentials, QGIS: Expressions, and QGIS: Working with Layers courses. These courses provide a comprehensive overview of QGIS and are a great way to get started with the software. After that, you have the option to advance your skills in certain areas of QGIS.

If you're interested in improving your visualization skills and creating better maps, the QGIS: Advanced Styling and Symbology and QGIS: Working with Maps and Layouts are excellent choices.

If you want to delve into geodata processing and analysis for specific applications, the QGIS: Raster Data Processing and Analysis, QGIS: Vector Data Processing and Analysis, and QGIS: Network Analysis courses will provide you with the necessary skills to work with these types of data.

If you're interested in customizing and automating workflows, the QGIS: Advanced and Automated Processing course will teach you how to create custom algorithms, scripts, and other automations.

Lastly, if you're interested in using Python in QGIS, the QGIS: Python Essentials and QGIS: Extending with Python and PyQGIS courses will teach you how to integrate Python with QGIS.

If you want to learn about spatial databases and how to utilize SQL for rapid, performant, and scalable geospatial solutions then you can enrol in the Spatial SQL and PostGIS: Essentials course.

## Interested in a custom course for your organization?

I offer custom training courses for organizations and clients.  It is similar to the publicly-available courses but with the following advantages:

1. The training agenda and training materials are tailored to directly address the needs and capacities of the organization/client based on a pre-training survey and meeting.
2. Training exercises can use your own datasets.
3. It can be held on-site/face-to-face subject to your availability (transportation to and from your area/location will be covered by your organization or added to the training fee)
