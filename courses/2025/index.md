## Interested in a custom course for your organization?

I offer custom training courses for organizations and clients.  It is similar to the publicly-available courses but with the following advantages:

1. The training agenda and training materials are tailored to directly address the needs and capacities of the organization/client based on a pre-training survey and meeting.
2. Training exercises can use your own datasets.
3. It can be held on-site/face-to-face subject to your availability (transportation to and from your area/location will be covered by your organization or added to the training fee)
