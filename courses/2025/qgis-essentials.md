## Interested in a custom course for your organization?

I offer custom training courses for organizations and clients.  It is similar to the publicly-available courses but with the following advantages:

1. The training agenda and training materials are tailored to directly address the needs and capacities of the organization/client based on a pre-training survey and meeting.
2. Training exercises can use your own datasets.
3. It can be held on-site/in-person subject to your availability.
