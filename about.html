   <h3 class="text-header">About the Author</h3>
   <p>Hi! My name is Ben. I'm a geospatial generalist and glass half full-stack software developer from the Philippines working in the fields of Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Remote Sensing (RS), Python Programming, and Free-and-Open-Source Software (FOSS) while dipping my toes in Data, AR & VR, Computer Vision, and AI.</p>
   <p>I'm an open-source and open-data advocate who believes in democratizing not only data but ​also ​the means of utilizing and analyzing data.​</p>
   <p>I develop software and bespoke GIS applications (desktop, web, mobile), integrate GIS with existing systems, and provide technical support and training with an expertise in Free and Open Source for Geospatial (FOSS4G) applications.</p>
   <p>I automate the boring stuff and join hackathons whenever I can.</p>
   <p>I'm passionate about sports analytics.</p>
   <p>I believe in the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">Four Essential Freedoms</a>.</p>
   <p>Still working on becoming a polymath.</p>

   <h3 class="text-header">About the Site</h3>
   <p>A programming blog / thought repository.</p>
   <p>A journal of my (mis)adventures in FOSS, geospatial, and programming with some random stuff thrown in every now and then.</p>
   <p>I'm optimistic that this gets me writing more again.</p>
   <p>I hope this helps someone learn more about Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS), RS, GIS, programming, and a lot of other things.</p>
