   <h3 class="text-header">About the Author</h3>
   <p>I'm Ben, a geomatics specialist and developer from Quezon City, PHL with a strong background in Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), RS/GIS applications, and geospatial programming.</p>
   <p>I automate the boring stuff and join hackathons whenever I can.</p>
   <p>I have a passion for sports analytics.</p>
   <p>I believe in the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">Four Essential Freedoms</a>.</p>
   <p>Still working on becoming a polymath.</p>

   <h3 class="text-header">About the Site</h3>
   <p>A programming blog / thought repository.</p>
   <p>A journal of my (mis)adventures in FOSS and Programming with some random stuff thrown in every now and then.</p>
   <p>I'm optimistic that this gets me writing more again.</p>
   <p>Lastly, I hope this helps someone learn more about Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS), Remote Sensing, Geographic Information Systems, and Programming (<em>especially geospatial programming with Python</em>).</p>
