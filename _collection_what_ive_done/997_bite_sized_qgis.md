about: Short, focused, and hands-on online courses designed to teach QGIS in bite-sized proportions. By having short and focused courses, we’re trying to ensure that participants don’t get overwhelmed while giving them freedom to choose to learn only what they want and pay only for what they need. Some people don’t need to learn everything about QGIS and are only interested in specific use cases and that’s entirely alright.<br>Sign up or learn more <a href="https://bnhr.xyz/training/events/bite-sized-qgis.html">here</a>.
