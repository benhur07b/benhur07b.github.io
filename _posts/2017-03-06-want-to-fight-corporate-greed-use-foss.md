*First of all, there's nothing wrong with using proprietary software as long as you acquire it legally. Second of all, I still think that FOSS can give proprietary software a run for their money any day of the week.*

I used to think that using pirated copies of software is one of the ways to stick it to the Man. I was probably thinking along the lines of *"I'll use your software but I won't pay for it to feed your corporate greed."*

At that time, knowing how to hook yourself and others up with ~~illegal~~ cracked versions of the latest software was a source of pride. I have to admit that it felt cool and empowering -- like I was freeing myself and others from the clutches of proprietary software companies.

But just like those old clothes that you think were cool when you were younger, once you get wiser, you begin to learn how mistaken you were.

You see, if you disagree with the idea of closed-source software or feel disdain towards software companies that earn money while hiding their source code, the best way to show your disapproval and the best form of dissent is **NOT** by using and distributing pirated copies of their software -- **IT'S BY DISREGARDING THEIR PRODUCTS AND EMBRACING FREE AND OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE (FOSS)**.

If you want to stick it to the Man, be a rebel, and don't mind living a bit dangerously, then the FOSS life just might be for you.

Let's go through some reasons why you are better off using FOSS than pirated software.
