Working in an environment where a majority of the computers are running Windows when you're using Linux is exciting and a bit frustrating at times. Recently, one of our computers (running Windows 8) at work was used as a make-shift file server so that everyone can connect and check the files there.

It came as a pleasant surprise that connecting to the shared folder on our Windows Machine was pretty straightforward.

## Requirements

### On the WINDOWS host/server
1. The IP address of the Windows server/host (you can check this using **ipconfig** in the command propmt or in the **Network and Connection Settings**)

2. The name of the shared folder

3. The shared folder must be accessible by everyone

### On your Linux (Xubuntu 16.04) machine
1. *cifs-utils*
    ```shell
    sudo apt install cifs-utils
    ```

2. A directory to mount the share folder
    ```shell
    sudo mkdir /media/windows-share
    ```

### Variables
**windows_ip** - the IP address of the Windows host/server

**sharename** - the name of the Shared folder

**mount_point** - the path where the shared folder will be mounted

## How-to
1. Open **/etc/fstab**.
    ```shell
    sudo nano /etc/fstab
    ```

2. Add the following lines and save.
    ```shell
    //windows_ip/sharename  mount_point   cifs  guest,uid=1000,iocharset=utf8   0   0
    ```

3. Reset **/etc/fstab**.
    ```shell
    sudo mount -a
    ```

The Windows share folder should now be mounted and you can access the files on your Linux machine.
