If you did not create your QGIS plugin using the latest version of *QGIS Plugin Builder*, you might find yourself encountering this error when running your plugin in QGIS specially if you have a resources file for images/logos that you included in your plugin.

```python
ImportError: No module named resources_rc
```

This error seems to stem from the fact that when you have resources in your GUI from *resource.qrc*, the following lines are added to your **.ui** files:

```
<resources>
  <include location="resources.qrc" \>
</resources>
```

[One of the solutions](https://gis.stackexchange.com/a/155599/45041) for this issue is by removing the said line in the **.ui** files and replacing them with:

```
<resources \>
```

then compiling the **.ui** files to **.py** files using **pyuic**.

However, my simpler solution involves just one command. Since python is looking for a resources_rc module, all I did was compile my resources.qrc to resources_rc.py instread of resources.py.

```shell
pyrcc resources.qrc -o resources_rc.py
```

And viola, my plugins worked and the images I added to the GUIs were all present.
