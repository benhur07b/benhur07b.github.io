description: You don't need to be a programmer to get into Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) and you don't need to give up a lot of functionalites when switching from Windows/macOS to GNU/Linux.

I encountered my very first computer (my aunt's) when I was 10 years old. Its specs can't be considered much by today's standards but back then I thought it was awesome. It had 128MB of RAM, 20GB of disk space, and ran on Windows 98. There I learned Microsoft Office with the help of Clippy and discovered the joy that was Microsoft Paint.

A few years later, my cousin got his own PC: 512MB of RAM and 80GB of disk space running on Windows XP. This was the computer that introduced me to the internet and torrent sites (because of Naruto and anime) -- all in the glory of the 56K dial-up speeds of the time. I fondly remember staying up till the wee hours of the morning just to take advantage of the off-peak hours promos of dial-up cards (you know, the ones that gave you free and unlimited browsing from 12MN to 6AM). Unbeknownst to me, this was actually training for all the all-nighters I would pull in college.

In high-school, I would learn some very basic programming using Visual, well, Basic.
