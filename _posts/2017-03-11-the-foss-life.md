I encountered my first computer when I was about 10 years old. It isn't much by today's standards but back then I thought it was awesome. I think it had 128MB of RAM and 20GB disk space. It ran on Windows 98. It was where I first used Micrsosoft Word and Excel. It also had Paint and, yes, I still remember the wonder of turning on that computer just so I can use Paint.
