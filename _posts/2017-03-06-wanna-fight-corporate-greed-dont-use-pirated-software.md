I used to think that using pirated copies of software is one of the ways to stick it to the Man and knowing where to find these copies were a source of pride.

I was probably thinking along the lines of *"I'll use your software but I won't pay for it to feed your corporate greed."* and at that time I have to admit that it felt cool and empowering -- like I was freeing myself from the clutches of proprietary software companies.

But just like those old clothes that you think were cool when you were younger, once you get wiser, you begin to learn how mistaken you were.

You see, if you disagree with the idea of closed-source software or feel disdain towards software companies that earn money while hiding their source code, the best way to show your disapproval and the best form of dissent is **NOT** by using and distributing pirated copies of their software -- **IT IS BY DISREGARDING THEIR PRODUCTS AND EMBRACING FREE AND OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE (FOSS)**. Yes, if you want to stick it to the Man, be a rebel, and don't mind living a bit dangerously, then the FOSS life just might be for you.

Now let's go through some reasons why you are better off using FOSS than pirated software.

#### **PIRATED SOFTWARE PROPAGATE THE STATUS QUO, FOSS IS A REVOLUTION**



Just to be clear, I don't see anything wrong with people using proprietary software as long as they pay for it. If you don't want to pay for it, don't pirate it. Use FOSS.
