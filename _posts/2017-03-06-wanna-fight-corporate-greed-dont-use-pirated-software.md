I used to think that using pirated copies of software is one of the ways to stick it to the Man and knowing where to find these copies were a source of pride.

I was probably thinking along the lines of *"I'll use your software but I won't pay for it to feed your corporate greed."*.

But just like those old clothes that you think were cool when you were younger, when you get wiser, you learn how wrong you were.
