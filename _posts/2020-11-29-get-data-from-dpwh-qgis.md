*DISCLAIMER: I don't condone getting, accessing, or hacking private data or any sensitive data. I am not part of or work for the DPWH. DPWH GIS data are hosted by an ArcGIS web service. The layers there, when not set to private, can be accessed by outside clients such as QGIS. If they set these to private, which they can, you won't be able to access them.*

DPWH or the Department of Public Works and Highways has [GIS Web Apps for [Roads and Bridges Inventory](https://www.dpwh.gov.ph/dpwh/gis/rbi), [Road Traffic Information](https://www.dpwh.gov.ph/dpwh/gis/rti), and [Detailed Bridge Inventory](https://www.dpwh.gov.ph/dpwh/gis/dbi). If you take a peek at these web apps, you will notice that these are hosted on an ArcGIS Map and Feature Servers. The layers there, when not set to private, can be accessed from outside clients such as QGIS. Here's how:

>
>* Go to **Browser Panel -> Right-click on ArcGIS Feature Service -> New connection**.
>* Enter the following details:

>```
>Name: DPWH
>URL: https://apps.dpwh.gov.ph/ArcGIS/rest/services

>* Click **OK**

You should now be able to see the databases and layers inside the said Feature Service from the QGIS Browser.

And load said layers in QGIS.

You can do the same with ArcGIS Map Service if you just want the tiles instead of the features.

Lastly, if you need road or building footprint data, you can just use OpenStreetMap. OpenStreetMap data can easily be loaded in QGIS by using the QuickOSM plugin as shown in this [post]({{ site.baseurl }}/2018/10/12/connecting-qgis-to-remote-services.html)

P.S. Please be a responsible data user. :)
