As a Research Associate on our team, your role involves assisting in conducting research on the gender gap in ICT in the ASEAN region. You will work closely with BNHR and SmartCT to collect and analyze data and contribute to research reports and outputs.

- The role is **output-based**: we prioritize the quality and timeliness of your outputs rather than require your physical or digital presence at specifict times/places.

#### Qualifications
- Bachelor’s degree or currently enroled in a relevant field or equivalent experience
- Basic knowledge of research methods, statistics, and data analysis
- Good eye for finding and getting data from different sources
- Strong spreadsheet-fu
