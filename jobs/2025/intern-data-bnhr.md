## About the role
#### Roles and key responsibilities

As a Data Associate (Student Intern), your role involves assisting BNHR in various data-related tasks while learning from experienced professionals and gaining valuable experience. These tasks include but are not limited to:
- collecting, processing, and analyzing spatial and non-spatial datasets using open source tools
- creating maps and visualizations
- participating in project meetings, workshops, and seminars related to the team's projects
- collaborating with team members to ensure consistency and quality of outputs

A specific task for this role is building a consistent spatial dataset that involves:
- editing and joining vector and attribute data
- georefencing and digitizing data

#### Working arrangements

- **Remote-friendly**: you can work from your own location (e.g. home office, co-working space, etc.) with some on-site requirements (e.g. on-site meetings).
- **Output-based**: we prioritize the quality and timeliness of your outputs rather than require your physical or digital presence at specific times/places.
- **Opportunities for extension**: the internship is scheduled for 10 weeks but based on performance or mutual interest, there may be a possibility for extending the internship or transitioning into a more permanent role.

#### Qualifications

- Currently enrolled in a relevant undergraduate program or equivalent experience
- Strong spreadsheet-fu
- Good understanding of geospatial concepts and data structures
- Familiarity with open source geospatial applications (e.g. QGIS, GDAL, etc.)
- Knowledge of programming languages such as Python or SQL is a plus. 

#### What we offer

- A monthly internship allowance in the range of PhP 9,000 to PhP 12,000 depending on experience, qualifications, and the amount of productive time logged.
