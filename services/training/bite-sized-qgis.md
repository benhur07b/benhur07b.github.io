# Bite-sized QGIS
*Learn QGIS one bite at a time.*

## What is Bite-sized QGIS?
Short, focused, and hands-on online courses designed to teach QGIS in bite-sized proportions. QGIS can be very complex and have a lot of nuances. By having short and focused courses, we're trying to ensure that participants don't get overwhelmed while at the same time giving them freedom to choose to learn only what they want and pay only for what they need. Some people don't need to learn everything about QGIS and are only interested in specific use cases and that's entirely alright.

You're a beginner who just wants to learn how to style and create maps? Take the Beginner-level Loading & Styling Layers in QGIS course. You're an experienced user who wants to learn how to do network analysis in QGIS? Take the Intermediate-level Network Analysis course. Courses are designed so they can be taken independently of each other.

**Online class and self-paced options are available.** Online classes are kept small to encourage participation and communication while also ensuring that everyone is given attention. **Both options include a FREE workbook, video materials, and online support.**

**Official QGIS Certificates are available.** BNHR is [QGIS Certifying Organization](https://changelog.qgis.org/en/qgis/certifyingorganisation/bnhr/). For a fee, you can get yourself officially certified with using QGIS. This fee is donated back to the QGIS project to help support and maintain it. You may opt to get one certificate for all the courses that you take.
