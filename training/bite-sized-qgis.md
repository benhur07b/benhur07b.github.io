# Bite-sized QGIS
*Learn QGIS one bite at a time.*

## What is Bite-sized QGIS?
Short, focused, and hands-on online courses designed to teach QGIS in bite-sized proportions. QGIS can be very complex and have a lot of nuances. By having short and focused courses, we're trying to ensure that participants don't get overwhelmed while at the same time giving them freedom to choose to learn only what they want and pay only for what they need. Some people don't need to learn everything about QGIS and are only interested in specific use cases and that's entirely alright.
<br><br>
You're a beginner who just wants to learn how to style and create maps? *Take the Beginner-level Loading & Styling Layers in QGIS course*. You're an experienced user who wants to learn how to do network analysis in QGIS? *Take the Intermediate-level Network Analysis course*. Courses are designed so they can be taken independently of each other.
<br><br>
Official QGIS Certificates are also available. You may opt to get one certificate for all the courses that you take. Each course comes with a workbook *(and answers!)*.

## Interested?
Sign-up or check out the courses below.
*Tentative schedule of courses are Saturdays and Sundays, 1:00 PM onward. You may check the calendar at the bottom for the tentative schedules. The payment and other details will be emailed to you after signing-up. You may [contact me](https://bnhr.xyz/#contact) if you have suggestions as to the content or schedule of the courses.*
